    <h2 class="w3-wide"> THE BULLY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM </h2>
    <p align="left">If there is one planet in the Solar System that dominates as far as size and mass are concerned, it is quite easily Jupiter.
	<br>
	<br>
	The mass of Jupiter is twice that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined!
	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="factbox">
    <h2 class="w3-wide"> A FAILED STAR </h2>
    <p align="left">Scientists often refer to Jupiter as a "failed star" because its atmosphere has a similar composition (is made of the same gases - mainly hydrogen and helium) to that of the Sun, and in the early days of the Solar System these gases and other material that went into forming Jupiter could have formed a star rather than a planet.
	<br>
	<br>
	This didn't happen because there wasn't enough material to form a star.
	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="factbox">
    <h2 class="w3-wide"> KING OF THE GODS </h2>
    <p align="left">In Roman mythology, Jupiter was the king of the gods and the god of the sky and thunder.
	<br>
	<br>
	The planet Jupiter is named after the Roman god of the same name.
	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="factbox">
    <h2 class="w3-wide"> THE FASTEST SPINNING PLANET IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM </h2>
    <p align="left">Even though it's enormous, Jupiter spins (rotates around its own axis) very quickly. A day on Jupiter (the time it takes to complete one such rotation) is only around 10 hours long.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="factbox">
    <h2 class="w3-wide"> THE GREAT RED SPOT </h2>
    <p align="left">One of the most famous features of Jupiter is The Great Red Spot - a large storm on the planet that is visible from space.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Great Red Spot is the largest storm in the Solar System. It is so large that you could fit around 3 Earths side-by-side inside it!
	<br>
	<br>
	It also seems to persist over time, never going away. We have known about it for at least 360 years!
	</p>

    <div class="factbox">
    <h2 class="w3-wide"> THE GALILEAN MOONS: A MINI SOLAR SYSTEM </h2>
    <p align="left">Out of Jupiter's moons, four are particularly large and easy to spot using a telescope on Earth. They are called the Galilean moons, because they were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei.
	<br>
	<br>
	These four moons orbit around Jupiter forming something of a "mini solar system" - the largest of the four moons, Ganymede, is larger than the planet Mercury!

  <br>
  <h1 class="w3-wide"> LIFE ON JUPITER? </h1>
  
  <ul>
<li>Jupiter, along with Saturn, is described as a “gas giant” because that’s precisely what it is – a giant ball of rotating gas. Thus there is no solid “surface” as such, but rather different layers of the clouds/atmosphere.</li>

<li>Any life on Jupiter would somehow need to be able to exist within the atmosphere, so it would need to either float or fly to be able to stay there. It would also need to withstand very hostile conditions. Jupiter is much further away from the Sun than any of the four rocky planets, so the temperature is much colder, far too cold for any known organisms on Earth to survive in. Many of the gases that make up Jupiter are also toxic to life.</li>

<li>We do not write off the possibility of life on Jupiter, as there is a certain altitude in the atmosphere at which the conditions are more hospitable (warmer temperatures and withstandable pressures) and where certain chemicals that are needed for life do exist. However, the probability is very small.</li>

<li>Not Jupiter itself, but much more interesting and potentially life-containing places are its four Galilean moons – Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Io is volcanically active and Europa is believed to have a liquid water ocean beneath the sheet of ice coating its surface. Plumes that shoot liquid water from above the surface of Europa have been observed.</li>

<li>There is a possibility of life existing in these oceans, just as where we find water on Earth we find life. It is believed that hydrothermal vents could provide the energy needed for life to exist near the sea-floor on Europa. Hydrothermal vents release water into the ocean that has been geothermally heated (heated by tectonic activity from deeper within Europa).</li>

<li>NASA plan to launch the Europa Clipper in 2024 – a spacecraft that will conduct a number of fly-bys of the moon, studying it in detail as it does so and refining our question of whether or not life could exist there.</li>

<li>Europa is also a promising place for establishing a human colony in the future, with the vast abundance of liquid water (if we can access it!) being an obvious advantage. Unfortunately, this is still no simple task. One of the most significant challenges humans on Europa would face is the high dose of deadly radiation coming from Jupiter above the ice sheet, from which we would need to shield ourselves, or permanently live under the ice.</li>

<li>The image below is an artist's concept of a 'cryobot' - a theoretical probe that could be deployed on Europa and drill through the surface ice to study the ocean of liquid water beneath. Could such a probe one day finally provide our species with the answer of whether or not we are alone in the Solar System?</li>
