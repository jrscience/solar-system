  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:1500px" id="band">
    <h1 class="w3-wide" style="font-size:60px">EXPLANATIONS</h1>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>A page dedicated to explaining some of the terminology used elsewhere on the website.</i></p>
    
  <!-- Day and year -->
  <br>
  <h1 class="w3-wide"> DAY AND YEAR </h1>
  
  <ul>
<li>Imagine the Earth in space. It is going round the Sun in what we can think of as (quite close to) a circular orbit. It is also spinning (like a spinning top).</li>

<li>These motions are what defines a <i>year</i> and a <i>day</i> on Earth, respectively. We call 1 "year" the time it takes for the Earth to make one complete trip around the Sun, coming back to its starting position after exactly one year has elapsed.</li>

<li>A day, on the other hand, is the time it takes for the Earth to make one complete rotation around its axis. We can think of an imaginary line passing right through the Earth, going through both of its poles (north and south). The Earth spins around this imaginary line (which is called the "axis" of the Earth.)</li>

<li>Technically, the time it takes for the Earth to make one complete rotation around its axis is called a "sidereal" day, which is slightly different to a "synodic" day, but this distinction is not important for the purpose of this explanation.</li>

<li>The lengths of a "year" and a "day" on other planets are not the same as on Earth. They have the same meanings, but some planets take longer to go round the Sun than others, because they orbit at a distance further out in the Solar System. As an example, we can compare the Earth with the next planet away from the Sun, Mars.</li>

<li>Because it is further away from the Sun than the Earth, Mars' path around the Sun covers a greater distance than the Earth's. That means it takes more time for Mars to make one complete trip around the Sun than it does for Earth to do the same thing. So 1 "year" on Mars is equivalent to a time we would call 1.88 years on Earth.</li>

<li>Furthermore, just as we said that Earth rotates around its axis, Mars does the same thing, but it is rotating at a slightly slower speed. That means it takes more time for Mars to make one complete rotation around <i>its</i> axis, so 1 "day" on Mars is about 37 minutes longer than what 1 day is on Earth.</li>

</ul>

<!-- Escape velocity -->
<br>
<h1 class="w3-wide"> ESCAPE VELOCITY </h1>

<ul>

<li>Suppose you are standing outdoors on a warm summer's day. What keeps you on the ground? What stops everything (people, cars, buildings, etc.) from floating away into space? The answer is GRAVITY.</li>

<li>Now, suppose you throw a ball up into the air. What happens? It gets to a certain height, then stops and starts to fall back down again. Why? Once again, the answer is gravity. Now suppose you throw the ball upwards with a bit more force. What happens? The ball goes higher, but still falls back down again.</li>

<li>If you kept throwing the ball with more and more force, you would find that it gets higher and higher before falling back down again. Eventually, you would throw the ball upwards with such a force that it would keep rising and wouldn't fall back down to Earth. It would rise through the clouds, past the upper atmosphere, and enter into outer space. It would no longer be gravitationally bound to the Earth. This is the idea of escape velocity - it is the minimum speed an object launched upwards from Earth's surface needs to escape its gravity and enter into space.</li>

<li>On Earth, this works out to be 11.2 kilometers per second (km/s), which is very fast indeed! (Probably faster than anyone could realistically throw a ball up into the air!)</li>

<li>Now suppose you could repeat the experiment on the surface of the Sun, supposing you had a special spacesuit that could keep you safe from the scorching temperatures. You would find that, in order to escape the Sun's gravitational pull, the same ball would need to be launched not at a speed of 11.2 km/s, but a whopping 615 km/s - almost 55 times faster! This is simply because the Sun's gravity is so much stronger than Earth's.</li>

<li>Incredibly, though we won't go into the mathematics here, it's possible to show that the escape velocity from a body like the Earth or the Sun is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass. So, whether you want to launch a cricket ball (mass = 0.163 kg) into space, or a Saturn V rocket (mass = 2,800,000 kg), they both must be launched at the same speed (11.2 km/s), to escape the Earth's gravity and enter into space.</li>

</ul>

<!-- Distances in astronomy -->
<br>
<h1 class="w3-wide"> DISTANCES IN ASTRONOMY </h1>
<ul>
<li>Space is simply enormous. Far bigger than anything the human mind can comprehend. In astronomy, it isn't practical to use familiar, everyday units of distance like meters or miles. Instead, we usually measure distances across the cosmos in a peculiar unit called a <i>light-year</i>. Note that this is a unit of distance - not time - even though it has the word "year" in it. 1 light-year (l.y. for short) is the distance travelled by a ray of light in a time of 1 year.</li>

<li>It is an unfathomably large distance (about 6 trillion miles, or 9 trillion kilometers) because light travels so quickly. There is nothing inside the Universe that can travel at a speed faster than the speed of light - this is a law of physics. But even though it travels so quickly, it doesn't travel infinitely fast - so it always take <i>some</i> time greater than zero for light to travel between places.</li>

<li>If a person stands on the other side of a room to you and shines a torch, you will not see the light from the torch at the moment the other person presses the "on" switch, but a few nanoseconds later. That's how long it takes the light to travel across an average-sized room. Of course, we human's don't notice this day-to-day, but in the vastness of space, these time delays are much more noticeable. Shine a torch into outer space, and the light won't reach the nearest star to us - Proxima Centauri - for another 4.3 <i>years!</i> (Indeed, Proxima Centauri is located 4.3 light-years from Earth.)</li>

<li>The distance between the Sun and the Earth is about 93 million miles which is about 8.3 light-minutes. So, the light from the Sun takes 8.3 minutes to reach us. Look near (NEVER DIRECTLY AT!) the Sun on a hot summer's day - and you are not seeing the Sun at that moment in time - you are seeing it as it was a time of 8.3 minutes ago! No-one on Earth has ever seen a sunset hapenning in real time.</li>

<li>In this respect - space is a time machine! Whenever we gaze at a starry night sky, we do not see the stars as they are at the present time. They are simply too far away - tens, hundreds and even thousands of light-years away. Pick any star in the night sky to look at, and there's a decent chance the light you're seeing left that very star <i>before you were born!</i></li>

<li>Some telescopes allow us to see objects billions of light-years away - and therefore allow us to look billions of years back in time - before the Earth was formed.</li>

<li>These vast distances in space are what some people propose as a solution to the infamous Fermi paradox - named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi - a simple way of putting it is as the question "Where is everybody?" or "Where are all the aliens?". Well, if an advanced civilization existed elsewhere in the Universe and wanted to communicate with humans on Earth, the fastest message they could send would travel at the speed of light. So if they were from another galaxy, say, a billion light-years away, then their message wouldn't reach us until a billion years after they sent it out into space, so we would have no knowledge whatsoever of their existence anytime before those billion years had passed.</li>
